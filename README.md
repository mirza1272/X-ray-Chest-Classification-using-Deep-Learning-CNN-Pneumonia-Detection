# X-ray Chest Classification using CNN 🫁📊

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image classifier that detects chest conditions (Normal, Pneumonia – viral or bacterial) from X-ray images. It uses data augmentation and keras-based training for accuracy and generalization.

> 📦 **Note:** Due to GitHub's file upload limits, the full dataset is uploaded as a `.rar` archive. Please extract it manually after cloning.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
- ImageDataGenerator (for augmentation)
- Google Colab

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- `Conv2D (32 filters)` → `MaxPool`
- `Conv2D (64 filters)` → `MaxPool`
- `Conv2D (128 filters)` → `MaxPool`
- `Flatten` → `Dense(128)` → `Dropout(0.6)`
- `Dense(3)` → `Softmax Activation`

## 📊 Model Performance

| Attempt | Accuracy | Overfitting |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Try 1  | > 0.81   | Slightly overfit |
| Try 2  | 0.78     | No overfitting ✅ |
| Try 3  | 0.79     | Slightly overfit |

---

## 📈 Training Visualizations

Training and validation accuracy and loss graphs are plotted for monitoring overfitting and performance during training.

---

## ✅ Evaluation

Final model is evaluated on the test set using:

- Accuracy
- Loss

Model checkpoint and early stopping were used for better generalization.
