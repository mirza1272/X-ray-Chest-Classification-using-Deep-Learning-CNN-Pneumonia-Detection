# X-ray-Chest-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-CNN-Pneumonia-Detection
This project uses a Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images into three categories: Normal, Pneumonia Bacterial, and Pneumonia Viral. The model is trained with data augmentation and evaluated on a separate test set with visualization of accuracy and loss curves.
